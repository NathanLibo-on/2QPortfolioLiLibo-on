    <h2><b>Sentinels are one of the four roles that agents are divided into in VALORANT. The abilities of agents under this role focus on defensive play, <br> with emphasis on supporting the 
        rest of the team through providing intel, anchoring down sites, and preventing the enemy from flanking.</b></h2>
    <h3><b>Below are a list of different sentinals that you may use in the game:</b></h3>
      
    <section style="background-color: rgb(214, 213, 172); border: solid 10px rgb(148, 147, 112); ">
    <h2 style="font-size: 40px; font-family: Brush Script MT; text-align: center;"><b>1. Deadlock </b></h2>

    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="../asset/deadlock.jpg" width="250" length="250">
    </div>
    <p style="font-size: 25px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; margin-right: 250px; margin-left: 250px; font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">  
        Deadlock is he fifth Sentinel added to the game. Coming from Norway, her abilities consist of high-tech nanowires to reel in her 
        enemies or stop them from entering a place or from moving entirely. She is a very useful agent to have on your team and can be  
        annoying for the enemy team. I would recommend using her if you really want your enemies to have a hard time attacking. </p>

    <section style="background-color: rgb(224, 222, 105); border: solid 10px rgb(165, 163, 67);">

Originating from Germany, she uses her self-made inventions to assist her in battle. 
        Her utilities include a turret that fires at enemies, a bot that seeks out enemies and explodes, and a lockdown device that dameges
        all enemies in its range. She is a very strong agent when defending and can be very useful when you want to hold down a site. I would
        also recommend her for beginners since her abilities are easy to use and understand. If you get used to her utilities, you can be more
        strategic with your gameplay.

He is a French agent, known for his sharp aim,  powerful custom firearms, and teleportation abilities, 
        allowing him to hold angles, pick off enemies from a distance, and quickly reposition. He is a high skill agent that requires exceptional aim and strategic sense to really use him, 
        which is why I don't recommend him for beginners.  </p>

He is a Moroccan agent who is the embodiment of the spy and 
        infiltrator archetype. Cypher's abilities involves various traps, which daze, restrain, and slow enemies in their range. He can also gather information on where the enemy is at, 
        making him very useful when you're defending. Although a bit complicated, it will be worth it to learn him order to be a useful teammate.</p>

He is a senagalese agent and is what most people would consider the most powerful agent in the game
        currently because of his abilities. His abilities include an interceptor that can block enemy projectiles and other enemy abbilities, a fragment that can stick to enemies and control
        their movement, and teleportation ability. The most powerful of abilities is his ultimate, which allows him to be basically immortal to all enemy abilities for a period of time. You 
        could consider playing him since he is a new agent and not many strategies have been developed to counter him yet.

       Vyse is the sixth Sentinel added to the game. She is of unknown origin but also a very annoying agent to go against. Her abilities consist of liquid metal to isolate, blind, trap, and 
       disarm  her enemies. If you love being annoying to your enemies, I would recommend playing her. She is a very strong agent when defending and can be very useful when you want to hold down
        a site.

    <h1 style="font-size: 50px; font-family: Brush Script MT; text-align: center;"> My Main Sentinal: Sage</h1>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
     <img src="../asset/sage.jpg" width="250" length="250">
     </div>
    <p style="font-size: 25px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; margin-right: 250px; margin-left: 250px; font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"> Sage is my favorite agent in valorant and my most played agent. She is one of the first sentinals added to valorant. Coming from china, her abilities are more suited towards a defensive
        playstyle. These include a healing orb that can heal and revive teammates, a slowing orb that can slow enemies, and a barrier orb that can create a wall to block enemy movement and line 
        of sight. Her ultimate ability allows her to heal all teammates to full health and revive one dead teammate. I love playing as sage because of her abilities are suited to my playstyle.
        Having the ability to heal and revive teammates makes me very valuable in team fights while not being in the frontlines. Her barriers can also block enemy movement and line of sight, 
        providing strategic advantages for my team. Additionally, her slowing abilities can control enemy movement and create opportunities for my team to capitalize on.
    </p>

    <h1 style="font-size: 35px; font-family: Brush Script MT;"> Tips on playing Sage </h1>
        
    <ol>
        <li style="font-size: 25px;"> Always keep an eye on your teammates' health and be ready to heal or revive them when needed. </li> 
        <li style="font-size: 25px;"> Use your barrier orb strategically to block enemy movement and line of sight, especially when defending a site. </li>
        <li style="font-size: 25px;"> Use your slowing orb to control enemy movement and create opportunities for your team to capitalize on. </li>
        <li style="font-size: 25px;"> Communicate with your team and coordinate your abilities with theirs to maximize their effectiveness. </li>
        <li style="font-size: 25px;"> Be aware of your positioning and avoid being caught out of position, as Sage is vulnerable to flanking and aggressive pushes. </li>
